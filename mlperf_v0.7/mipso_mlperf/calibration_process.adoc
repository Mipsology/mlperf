We quantize the network parameters and the activations to 8-bit signed integers. The quantization is performed by multiplying the parameters by scaling values, clamping the results to the 8-bit integer range and rounding to nearest integer. No retraining is performed nor labeled data used.
The softmax layer is not quantized and executed on the CPU.

The quantization uses one of the calibration sets and is performed in a couple of minutes. The scaling parameters are chosen using the data obtained from computing the calibration set.
The weights are quantized using per-channel symmetric quantization.
The biases and activations are quantized using per-tensor symmetric quantization.
